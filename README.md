### What I learned

The biggest challenge for me was the two toned logo. I'm sure there are many ways to skin this cat so I'm looking forward to seeing how other's solved the problem.

Though I didn't necessarily need to use an image mask, this is the path I went down and it forced me to learn how to use masks, which is a powerful tools!

### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning how to leverage masks and clips to add creative animations. I'm also going to start working on projects involving vanilla javascript.
